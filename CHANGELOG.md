### Other Changes

*   **Improved CI/CD Workflow Robustness:** The automated changelog generation workflow (`.github/workflows/changelog.yml`) now dynamically discovers the `changelog.py` script's location, enhancing the workflow's flexibility and resilience to changes in the script's file path within the repository.
*   **Initial Changelog File:** An initial `CHANGELOG.md` file has been created to track future changes.
