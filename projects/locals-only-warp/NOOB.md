## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "It's not working!"
1. **Check your API key**: Make sure you copied it correctly
2. **Check the APIs**: Ensure you enabled all required APIs in Google Cloud
3. **Try a different browser**: Sometimes Safari/Edge have issues
4. **Check the terminal**: Look for error messages in red text

### Common Issues:

#### "This page can't be displayed" or "Site can't be reached"
- Make sure the app is still running in the terminal
- Try `http://127.0.0.1:5005` instead of `localhost:5005`

#### "Google Maps API key required" error
- Your API key is missing or incorrect
- Check that you saved the `.env` file properly
- Ensure your API key has the right permissions

#### Docker issues on Windows
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Try restarting Docker Desktop
- Make sure you have WSL2 installed (Docker will prompt you)

#### Python "command not found"
- Make sure you checked "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- On Mac/Linux, try `python3` instead of `python`

## üÜò Getting Help

If you're completely stuck:

1. **Check the terminal output** - error messages often explain what's wrong
2. **Try the health check**: Go to `http://localhost:5005/api/health` in your browser
3. **Google the error message** - someone else has probably had the same issue
4. **Ask for help** - include the error message from your terminal

---

## üéä Success!

If you can see the Locals Only app in your browser and search for local places, **congratulations!** You've successfully:

- ‚úÖ Set up a Google Cloud account and API key
- ‚úÖ Installed Docker or Python
- ‚úÖ Downloaded and configured the app
- ‚úÖ Started your first local web application

**You're no longer a complete beginner!** üéâ

---

## üîê Security Notes

- **Never share your API key** publicly
- **Don't commit your .env file** to version control
- **Use API restrictions** to limit where your key can be used
- **Monitor your usage** in Google Cloud Console (it should stay free for personal use)

---

**Ready to explore your neighborhood? Happy local discovery!** üó∫Ô∏è‚ú®
