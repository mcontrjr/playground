on Eastern time, that we receive your payment request.
If you send an eligible check, you authorize us to complete your payment by 
electronic debit. If we do, the checking account will be debited in the amount 
on the check. We may do this as soon as the day we receive the check. Also, 
the check will be destroyed.
